# Recommendation-System
In an increasingly competitive restaurant industry, businesses strive to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty through personalised recommendations. Leveraging the Yelp restaurant dataset, the project aims to develop a recommendation system that provides tailored suggestions for dining experiences based on user preferences, historical data, and contextual factors. The system will employ advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior, restaurant characteristics, and reviews to generate accurate and relevant recommendations. By integrating data-driven insights with user-centric preferences, the recommendation system seeks to optimize dining experiences, drive customer engagement, and promote business growth in the dynamic restaurant landscape.
